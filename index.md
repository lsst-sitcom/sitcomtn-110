# TMA Performance Settings vs Capacitor Bank

```{abstract}
We want to compare the maximum velocity, acceleration and jerk on every slew with the minimum value of the capacitor banks on the TMA.

Phase, the contractor responsible for the TMA Power Supply and the Capacitor Banks, suggests that we keep these voltage drops above 575 V.
